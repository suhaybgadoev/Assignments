Git Assignments 

•	Clone – Making the duplicate or copy of codes/commands/or repositories from the remote/cloud based storages into your local machines and vice versa  

•	Push - Uploading the data or any changes that you make in your repository from your local machine into the cloud servers/remote data storages 


•	Pull – Downloading or extracting the data from the cloud/remote servers into your local machine to make changes

•	Commit – The process of timestamping and recording the changes that occur in the repositories 


•	Repository – The collection/total of all data and files (including any data/files that have been changed over time) that are stored remotely in the cloud servers and local machines as well 


•	Git – is the version control system software (that can be installed locally in your machines) that keeps the track of all changes that you make while developing any kind of repositories 
 
•	GitHub – is also a version control system that keeps the track of all changes that you make in your repositories. Unlike the Git, the GitHub offers both local and cloud-based service that anyone can share 	their repositories with others and make changes together 

 
•	GitHub desktop – the desktop version of GitHub service that can be installed and used locally. From there you can share the changes with others online
